# Char RNN and Random Decoding
This project implements a character-level language model using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network in PyTorch. The model is trained on the text of The Mysterious Island by Jules Verne, available from Project Gutenberg. The aim is to generate text that resembles the original text by learning the sequential patterns of characters.
